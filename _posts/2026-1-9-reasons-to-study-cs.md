1. CS majors adapt across industries
	 - quant finance / trader / dev
	 - swe / ai / ml / cloud / cybersecurity / devops
	 - embedded systems / robotics / systems analyst
	 - data science / analyst / block chain / IT
	 - bioinformatics / research scientist
2. Combines multiple academic fields
	- cs + x major = higher impact
		- cs + math = computational theory, ai/ml, optimization
		- cs + physics = simulations, modeling, quantum computing
		- cs + bio = bioinformatics
		- cs + poli sci = ai policy / regulation, ai ethics
		- cs + psych = hci, ui/ux
3. AI has expanded cs value; not diminish it
	 -  programming -> systems
	 - for SWE, just a shift from programming systems to understanding systems and showing the AI model how to create code that aligns with the system that you have in mind
4. Fundamental building block for the future
	- frameworks, programming languages will change, but logic and reasoning won't
	- it is essential to pick up this line of reasoning as it will help you solve so many problems
	- similar to learning how to solve proofs in mathematics
5. CS trains your creative thinking
	- algorithm: tradeoffs between memory and time complexity
	- systems: designing tools/programs that scale and don't break
	- debugging: finding uncertain creative solutions to unintended errors
	- abstraction: creating structured logic that serves a pursue (library, data structure)
6. Prepares you for life-long learning
	- the nature of the field requires you to learn, if you don't you will drown & lose your spot
	- innovation is just tuesday
	- reflection is friday
	- mastery never ends, and there's always something new to learn everyday
7. CS is a very inclusive field
	- Getting to a point that it's similar to math and literature, where a huge chunk of fields benefit with advancements made in CS  
	- most inclusive: math & literature
	- most grad programs will require you to utilize some sort of programming language or tool to model your findings
