Although I took the starting steps from SWE to Scientist in 2025. I think what I do in 2026 should probably ease the transition.

Since we're moving from 2025 -> 2026, here are some main goals that I have in mind to accomplish:

1. Read more books for fun, at least three, could be non-fiction or fiction
2. Make at least one blog per month
3. Workout 3 to 4 times a week
4. Publish a research paper
5. Get a 4.0 GPA in Spring 2026 and Fall 2026
6. Apply to graduate school
7. Build at least one coding project
8. Grow and maintain relationships
9. Take every opportunity seriously
10. Read through the bible
