on sunday, i tried sushi for the first time, i went to sushi sack with my roomates to the spot, because  one of my roomates brother was in town, and it was valentines day. i think we stayed there like 4 hours. there was like an houor and 30 minutes cooldown in between each round of sushi rolls. Oh also, I forgot to mention that it was a all you can eat sushi, so we paid $125 for 5 people and we eat like 17 rolls of sushi. i think that each roll of sushi has 10 thinly sliced pieces.

as for my favorite types, i think i liked the gold california roll, chicken teriyaki roll, and the louisana roll. in general, there had to be protein in the roll, and that protein had to be cooked for me to enjoy it usually. soy sauce can either help or mess up the taste test tbh. 

i also learned that i gotta upgrade my chopstick game. it was actually frustrating to eat sushi with the chopsticks, so much that i got a fork, and even with the fork sometimes the middle part of the sushi would completely fall out just leaving me with the seaweed and rice

thinking back introspectively, it was pretty funny though. i'd rate sushi like a 6/10, something that i can eat, but definitely nowhere near my first choice
