Hey y'all, I am a junior from the University of Texas at Dallas, majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Cognitive Science, and pursuing a certificate in quantum information science

My research interests lie in **machine learning and quantum computing**. 
* Machine Learning: Understanding how models learn, scale, and generalize; developing methods for interpretability, reasoning, and alignment; utilizing these methods in NLP
* Quantum Computing: Exploring quantum algorithms and hybrid quantum-classical systems to identify when quantum resources provide real advantages for learning
* Bridging ML & Quantum: Advancing both theory and practice to create intelligent systems with meaningful real-world applications in science and technology


Overall I am interested about the intersection of machine learning and quantum computing.
